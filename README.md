# How to add a custom view to the data label of a .NET MAUI Chart
This repository contains a sample project demonstrating how to add a custom view to the data label of a .NET MAUI Cartesian Chart using Syncfusion controls.

## Overview

In .NET MAUI applications, data visualization plays a crucial role in presenting information effectively to users. Syncfusion provides powerful controls for .NET MAUI, including the Cartesian Chart control, which allows developers to create interactive and visually appealing charts.

One common requirement in charting applications is the ability to customize the appearance of data labels. This sample demonstrates how to add a custom view to the data label of a .NET MAUI Chart. The custom view includes a label displaying the value of the data point and an image indicating the trend based on the value.

## Defining the Custom View

We create a DataTemplate named “dataLabel”, consisting of a StackLayout containing a Label. This label displays the value of the data point and utilizes a converter to dynamically change its color based on the value. And the Image control displays the respective image based on the data point and utilized a convertor to dynamically change its image based on the value.

## Implementing the Value Converter

The **ValueToColorConverter** and **ValueToImageConverter** classes are implemented to handle the logic of changing text color and displaying icons based on the value, respectively. These converters are applied to the TextColor and Source properties within the data label template. The **ValueToSummaryValueConverter** class is used to return the sum of the data point values, with the sum accumulating as each data point passes through this converter.

## Integrating the Custom View with the Chart

Incorporate the custom view into your chart by assigning the LabelTemplate property of the series to the defined DataTemplate. Ensure that the **ShowDataLabels** property is set to **True** to display the data labels.
