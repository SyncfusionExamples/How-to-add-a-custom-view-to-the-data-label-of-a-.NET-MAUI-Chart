# How to add a custom view to the data label of a .NET MAUI Toolkit

This repository contains a sample project demonstrating how to add a custom view to the data label of a .NET MAUI Toolkit using Syncfusion controls.

**Syncfusion Chart Control**

The [.NET MAUI Charts](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-cartesian-charts) provides a perfect way to visualize data with a high level of user involvement that focuses on development, productivity, and simplicity of use. Chart also provides a wide variety of charting features that can be used to visualize large quantities of data, as well as flexibility in data binding and user customization.

**Defining the Custom View**

Create a DataTemplate for the data label, which typically includes a StackLayout containing a Label to display the value of the data point and an Image to indicate the trend. Customize the appearance of the label and image as needed.

**Implementing the Value Converter**

Utilize value converters to dynamically adjust the appearance of the label and image based on the data point's value. For example, you might use a converter to change the text color of the label or to select a specific icon for the image based on the data value.

**Integrating the Custom View with the Chart**

Assign the DataTemplate you created to the [LabelTemplate](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui-toolkit/Syncfusion.Maui.Toolkit.Charts.ChartSeries.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Toolkit_Charts_ChartSeries_LabelTemplate) property of the series within your chart. Ensure that the [ShowDataLabels](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui-toolkit/Syncfusion.Maui.Toolkit.Charts.ChartSeries.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Toolkit_Charts_ChartSeries_ShowDataLabels) property is set to True to enable the display of data labels.

## Troubleshooting

**Path too long exception**

If you are facing a path too long exception when building this example project, close Visual Studio and rename the repository to a shorter name before building the project.
